			<h1>I want to be a Full Stack Web Developer</h1>
			
			<h4> What does "Full" in Full Stack mean?</h4>
			
			<img src="../images/drawing.svg.png"> 
			<h5><a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/full-stack-developer/">Full</a> means that you develop both the front end and the back end. The front end is what the users sees on what is called the client computer. The back end is what is on the server computer that delivers content to the front end </h5>

			<h4> What does "Stack" in Full Stack mean? </h4>
			<h5><a href="https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/stack_computers/sec1_2.html">Stack</a> means that several programs, a "stack" of programs is used. On the front end I will use HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. On the back end I use PHP, and MySQL. And I also have a LAMP stack on my server computer. </h5>

			<h4>What does "LAMP Stack" mean</h4>
			<h5><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10060285/what-is-a-lamp-stack">LAMP</a> is a stack used for our web page server - remember, a server sends web pages to a client. LAMP Stands for: L = Linux, the basis of our server operating system A = Apache, our web server M = MySQL, the database we use, P = PHP, the programming language used on the server side. </h5>

				1. Explain DB:
					A database is somewhat like an list of items found in a store. Each item has a price value, location, and category property defined on the list. In the same way, a database can contain information on any data and keep track of it, so that it can be used in the future.
			</p>
			<p>				
				2. Explain MySQL:
					Number 2 among the most-used DB's in the entire world! Oracle is number one, however it is a paid service. MySQL is a database manager and allows you to manipulate the data within a database.
			</p>
			<p>
				3. Explain SQL: Structured Query Language. MySQL is the name of the database, while MySQL is the language you use inside of that database to answer questions.
			</p>
			<p>
				4. PHP is a programming language that connects front end to back end. PHP reads HTML forms, then sends that form info to the server. PHP also reads the DB, and sends that back in another HTML form.
			</p>
			<p>
				MySQL table: Has rows and columns, where data is organized in cells (rows are horizontal, columns are vertical)
			</p>
			<p>
				6. MySQL from the CLI (Command Line Interface) -- NTS, structure when done
				
				-- The User Interface for DB's are HTML pages that WE create!
				-- The CLI is where experts, where the Power Users can see inside of the DB but in a very primitive non-GUI way
